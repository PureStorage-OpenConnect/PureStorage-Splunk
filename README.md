# PureStorage-Splunk
An App &amp; TA for monitoring Pure Storage FlashArrays in a Splunk environment.

The certified and supported versions of these plugins are available for download or install through splunkbase.  
App - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3660/  
TA - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3659/  

## Installation
The App and the TA are installed separately into your splunk environment via one of two methods  
1 - You can directly install the versions available in splunkbase  
2 - Follow the directions in the README for either the [App](PureStorage-App/README.md) or [TA](PureStorage-TA/README.md)

## Usage
In order to pull information from FlashArrays into Splunk, the TA is mandatory since it connects to FlashArrays and converts the data to a standard Splunk format. The App is optional, but provides a set of pre-configured dashboards which provide a fleet monitoring experience out of the box.

## More Information
Check the READMEs for the [App](PureStorage-App/README.md) or [TA](PureStorage-TA/README.md) for additional information.
